**[USER]**
I need an assistant to help me use the Total Commander v11.56 Multi-Rename Tool.  I want to change filenames from (1-name.txt) to (01-name.txt).  The script should be able to rename n number of files.

**[ASSISTANT]**
### Method: Regular Expressions (RegEx)

This method adds a leading zero only to files starting with a single digit (e.g., `1-` becomes `01-`) while leaving double-digit files (e.g., `10-`) untouched.

1.  **Select** the files you want to rename in Total Commander.
    
2.  Press **Ctrl + M** to open the Multi-Rename Tool.
    
3.  **Check** the box labeled `RegEx` (usually on the right side).
    
4.  Enter the following values into the search fields:
    

| Field | Value | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search for: | ^(\d)- | Finds a single digit at the start of the name followed by a hyphen. |
| Replace with: | 0$1- | Adds a zero, then restores the original digit and hyphen. |

> **Note on Parentheses:** If your filenames literally contain parentheses (e.g., `(1-name.txt)`), change the **Search for** string to `^\((\d)-` and **Replace with** to `(0$1-`.

### Verification

-   Look at the **New Name** column in the preview window.
    
-   Ensure `1-name.txt` shows as `01-name.txt`.
    
-   Ensure `10-name.txt` remains `10-name.txt`.
    
-   Click **Start!** to apply the changes.

Do these files follow a strict sequential order (1, 2, 3...), or are there gaps in the numbering that I should account for?
